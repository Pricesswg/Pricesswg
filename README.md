- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pricesswg
- 👀 I’m interested in Learning coding and develop templates and utilities for DCS World.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript (and a little bit of LUA sometimes)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating templates and modules for DCS World simulations. i like to build templates that represent realistic combat situation
whith historical condition to use in multiplayer. BTW i'm just learning now how to use external templates such as MOOSE framework and IADS, but the mission editor
is not a prblem for me. Feel free to try some of my templates.
- 📫 How to reach me: send an email to info@104ww.it

I really need someone to cooperate whit me to create a virtual cockpit for the f-18 module using arduino, if you have some sort of guide or files to start whit the preliminary version of the idea please send it to me, Thanks in advance!
