- 👀 I’m interested in Learning coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, HTML, CSS and Javascript (and a little bit of LUA sometimes)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating templates and modules for DCS World simulations. i like to build templates that represent realistic combat situation
whith historical condition to use in multiplayer. BTW i'm just learning now how to use external templates such as MOOSE framework and IADS, but the mission editor
is not a prblem for me. Feel free to try some of my templates.
